There are three functions in the database module:

1. databasetomodel(modelversion_id, modelname=False):

Takes a modelversion_id as the argument and builds a cobra model object.
It also outputs an sbml file of the model.

2. todatabase(file, description=False, modelversion_id=False):  

Takes an sbml file as input, builds a cobra model and stores the model data
in the grmit database. It returns the value of the modelversion_id. 

3. def compare(model1, model2, logic='IN', table='reaction'):
# use:
# default, reactions in common to model1 and model2: compare(1,2)
# reactions, exclusive to model1: compare(1,2,'NOT IN', 'reaction')
# metabolites, all in common: compare(1,2,'IN', 'metabolite')
# metabolites, exclusive to model1: compare(1,2, 'NOT IN', 'metabolite')
